# Learn Relational Databases by Building a Mario Database

1.  Your virtual machine comes with PostgreSQL installed. You will use the Psql terminal application to interact with it. Log in by typing `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres` into the terminal and pressing enter.
2.  Notice that the prompt changed to let you know that you are now interacting with PostgreSQL. First thing to do is see what databases are here. Type \l into the prompt to list them.
3.  The databases you see are there by default. You can make your own like this:
    `CREATE DATABASE database_name;`
    The capitalized words are keywords telling PostgreSQL what to do. The name of the database is the lowercase word. **Note that all commands need a semi-colon at the end**. Create a new database named **first_database**.
4.  It worked. Your new database is there. If you don't get a message after entering a command, it means it's incomplete and you likely forgot the **semi-colon**. You can just add it on the next line and press enter to finish the command. Create another database named **second_database**
5.  You can connect to a database by entering `\c database_name`. You need to connect to add information. Connect to your second_database.
6.  You should see a message that you are connected. Notice that the prompt changed to **second_database=>**. So the **postgres=>** prompt before must have meant you were connected to that database. A database is made of tables that hold your data. Enter `\d` to **display** the tables.
7.  Looks like there's no tables or relations yet. Similar to how you created a database, you can create a table like this:
    `CREATE TABLE table_name();`
    Note that the **parenthesis** are needed for this one. It will create the **table** in the database you are connected to. Create a table named first_table in second_database.
8.  You can view more details about a table by adding the table name after the display command like this:` \d table_name`. View more details about your second_table.
9.  Tables need **columns** to describe the data in them, yours doesn't have any yet. Here's an example of how to add one:
    `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;`
    Add a column to second_table named first_column. Give it a data type of **INT**. **INT** stands for integer. Don't forget the semi-colon.
10. Your column is there ðŸ˜„ Use `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN` to add another column to **second_table** named id that's a type of **INT**.
11. Your table should have an id column added. View the details of second_table to make sure.
12. Those are some good looking columns. You will probably need to know how to remove them. Here's an example:
    `ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;`
    Drop your age column.
13. A common data type is `VARCHAR`. It's a short string of characters. You need to give it a maximum length when using it like this: `VARCHAR(30)`.

14. Add a new column to **second_table**, give it a name of **name** and a data type of **VARCHAR(30)**.
15. You can see the **VARCHAR** type there. The **30** means the data in it can be a max of 30 characters. You named that column **name**, it should have been username. Here's how you can rename a column:
    `ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN column_name TO new_name`;
    Rename the name column to username.
16. It worked. Rows are the actual data in the table. You can add one like this:
    `INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2) VALUES(value1, value2);`
    **Insert** a row into **second_table**. Give it an **id** of **1**, and a **username** of **Samus**. The username column expects a **VARCHAR**, so you need to put **Samus** in single quotes like this: `'Samus'`.

17. You should have one row in your table. You can view the data in a table by querying it with the **SELECT** statement. Here's how it looks:
    `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
    Use a SELECT statement to view all the columns in second_table. Use an asterisk (\*) to denote that you want to see all the columns.
18. There's your one row. **Insert** another row into **second_table**. Fill in the id and username columns with the values **2** and **'Mario'**.
19. Insert another row into second_table. Use 3 as the id, and Luigi as the username this time.
20. That gives me an idea ðŸ˜ƒ You can make a database of **Mario** video game characters. You should start from scratch for it. Why don't you delete the record you just entered. Here's an example of how to delete a row:`DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
    Remove Luigi from your table. The condition you want to use is username='Luigi'
21. It's gone. You can scrap all this for the new database. Delete Mario from second_table using the same command as before, except make the condition username='Mario' this time.
22. Looks like they're all gone. Remind yourself what columns you have in second_table by looking at its details.
23. There's two columns. You won't need either of them for the Mario database. Alter the table second_table and drop the column username.
24. Okay, the table has no rows or columns left. View the tables in this database to see what is here.
    1. Use the display shortcut command
25. Still two. You won't need either of those for the new database either. Drop second_table from your database. Here's an example: `DROP TABLE table_name;`
26. Rename first_database to mario_database. You can rename a database like this: `ALTER DATABASE database_name RENAME TO new_database_name;`
27. Now that you aren't connected to second_database, you can drop it. Use the `DROP DATABASE` keywords to do that.
28. Okay, I think you're ready to get started. I don't think you created any tables here, take a look to make sure.
29. Create a new table named characters, it will hold some basic information about Mario characters
30. Next, you can add some columns to the table. Add a column named **character_id** to your new table that is a type of **SERIAL**.
31. The **SERIAL** type will make your column an **INT** with a **NOT NULL** constraint, and automatically increment the integer when a new row is added. View the details of the characters table to see what SERIAL did for you.
32. Add a column to characters called name. Give it a data type of **VARCHAR(30)**, and a constraint of **NOT NULL**. Add a constraint by putting it right after the data type.
33. You can make another column for where they are from. Add another column named **homeland**. Give it a data type of **VARCHAR** that has a max length of **60**.
34. You are ready to start adding some rows. First is Mario. Earlier, you used this command to add a row:
    `INSERT INTO second_table(id, username) VALUES(1, 'Samus');`
    The first parenthesis is for the column names, you can put as many columns as you want. The second parenthesis is for the values for those columns. Add a row to your table, give it a name of **Mario**, a homeland of **Mushroom Kingdom**, and a favorite_color of **Red**. Make sure to use single quotes where needed.
35. Use `SELECT * FROM characters;` to view that the character_id has changed now.
36. Add another row for Luigi. Give it a name of **Luigi**, a homeland of **Mushroom Kingdom**, and a favorite_color of **Green**.
37. View all the data in your characters table with SELECT again.
38. Adding rows one at a time is quite tedious. Here's an example of how you could have added the previous three rows at once:
    `INSERT INTO characters(name, homeland, favorite_color)
VALUES('Mario', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Red'),
('Luigi', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Green'),
('Peach', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Pink');`
    Add two more rows. Give the first one the values: Toadstool, Mushroom Kingdom, and Red. Give the second one: Bowser, Mushroom Kingdom, and Green. Try to add them with one command.
39. If you don't get a message after a command, it is likely incomplete. This is because you can put a command on multiple lines. Add two more rows. Give the first one the values: Daisy, Sarasaland, and Yellow. The second: Yoshi, Dinosaur Land, and Green. Try to do it with one command.
40. It looks good, but there's a few mistakes. You can change a value like this:
    `UPDATE table_name SET column_name=new_value WHERE condition;`
    You used username='Samus' as a condition earlier. SET Daisy's favorite_color to Orange. You can use the condition name='Daisy' to change her row.
41. The command you just used does exactly what it sounds like. It finds the row where name is Daisy, and sets her favorite_color to Orange. Take a look at all the data in your table again to see if she got updated.
42. Her favorite color was updated. Toadstool's name is wrong as well, it's actually Toad. Use UPDATE to SET his name to Toad. Use the condition favorite_color='Red'.
43. Using favorite_color='Red' was not a good idea. Mario's name changed to Toad because he likes red, and now there's two rows that are the same. Well, almost. Only the character_id is different. You will have to use that to change it back to Mario. Use UPDATE to set the name to Mario for the row with the lowest character_id.
44. Actually, you should put that in order. Here's an example:
    SELECT` columns FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name;`
    View all the data again, but put it in order by character_id.
    1. Try entering SELECT \* FROM characters ORDER BY character_id;
45. It looks good. Next, you are going to add a **primary key**. It's a column that uniquely identifies each row in the table. Here's an example of how to set a PRIMARY KEY:
    `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY(column_name);`
    The name column is pretty unique, why don't you set that as the primary key for this table.
46. You should set a primary key on every table and there can only be one per table. Take a look at the details of your characters table to see the primary key at the bottom.
47. You can see the key for your name column at the bottom. It would have been better to use character_id for the primary key. Here's an example of how to drop a constraint:
    `ALTER TABLE table_name DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name;`
    Drop the primary key on the name column. You can see the constraint name is characters_pkey.
48. View the details of the characters table to make sure it's gone.
49. That's better. The table looks complete for now. Next, create a new table named more_info for some extra info about the characters.
50. I wonder what that third one is. It says characters_character_id_seq. I think I have a clue. View the details of the characters table
51. That is what finds the next value for the character_id column. Add a column to your new table named more_info_id. Make it a type of SERIAL.
52. Set your new column as the primary key for this table.
53. There it is. Add another column to more_info named birthday. Give it a data type of DATE
54. Add a weight column. Give it a type of **NUMERIC(4, 1)**. That data type is for decimals. **NUMERIC(4, 1)** has up to four digits and one of them has to be to the right of the decimal.
55. Thereâ€™s your four columns and the primary key you created at the bottom. To know what row is for a character, you need to set a foreign key so you can relate rows from this table to rows from your characters table. Here's an example that creates a column as a foreign key:
    `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE REFERENCES referenced_table_name(referenced_column_name);`
    That's quite the command. In the more_info table, create a character_id column. Make it an INT and a foreign key that references the character_id column from the characters table. Good luck.
56. To set a row in more_info for Mario, you just need to set the character_id (foreign key) value to whatever it is in the characters table. Take a look at the details of more_info to see your foreign key.
57. There's your foreign key at the bottom. These tables have a **"one-to-one"** relationship. One row in the **characters** table will be related to exactly one row in **more_info** and vice versa. Enforce that by adding the **UNIQUE** constraint to your foreign key. Here's an example:
    `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD UNIQUE(column_name);`
    Add the UNIQUE constraint to the column you just added.
58. The column should also be **NOT NULL** since you don't want to have a row that is for nobody. Here's an example:
    `ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name SET NOT NULL;`
    Add the NOT NULL constraint to your foreign key column.
59. The structure is set, now you can add some rows. First, you need to know what **character_id** you need for the **foreign key column**.
60. You have viewed all columns in a table with \*. You can pick columns by putting in the column name instead of \*. Use SELECT to view the character_id column from the characters table.
61. That list of numbers doesn't really help. Use **SELECT** again to display both the **character_id** and **name** columns from the _characters_ table. You can separate the column names with a comma to view both.
62. That's better. You can see Mario's id there. Here's some more info for him:

    |  birthday  | height | weight |
    | :--------: | :----: | :----: |
    | 1981-07-09 |  155   |  64.5  |

    Add a row to **more_info** with the above data for **Mario** using the `INSERT INTO` and `VALUES` keywords. Be sure to set his **character_id** when adding him. Also, **DATE** values need a string with the format: **'YYYY-MM-DD'**.
    `INSERT INTO more_info(birthday, height, weight, character_id) VALUES('1981-07-09', 155, 64.5, 1);`

63. Next, you are going to add some info for **Luigi**. Use `SELECT` again to view the **character_id** and **name** columns from the characters table to find his id.
64. You can see Luigi's id there. Here's his info:

    |  birthday  | height | weight |
    | :--------: | :----: | :----: |
    | 1983-07-14 |  175   |  48.8  |

    Add a row in **more_info** for **Luigi** using the above info. Be sure to add his **character_id** as well.

65. Here's the additional info for Peach:

    |  birthday  | height | weight |
    | :--------: | :----: | :----: |
    | 1985-10-18 |  173   |  52.2  |

    Add a row for **Peach** using the above info. Be sure to add her **character_id** as well.

    `mario_database=> INSERT INTO more_info(birthday, height, weight, character_id) VALUES('1985-10-18', 173, 52.2, 3);`

66. Toad is next. Instead of viewing all the rows to find his id, you can just view his row with a **WHERE** condition. You used several earlier to delete and update rows. You can use it to view rows as well. Here's an example:

    `SELECT columns FROM table_name WHERE condition;`

    A condition you used before was **username='Samus'**. Find Toad's id by viewing the **character_id** and **name** columns from characters for only his row.

67. Here's what Toad's info looks like:

|  birthday  | height | weight |
| :--------: | :----: | :----: |
| 1950-01-10 |   66   |  35.6  |

Add the above info for Toad. Be sure to add his **character_id**

68. View all the data in more_info to see the rows you added.
69. Bowser is next. Find his id by viewing the character_id and name columns for only his row.
70. Here's what Bowser's info looks like:

    |  birthday  | height | weight |
    | :--------: | :----: | :----: |
    | 1990-10-29 |  258   |  300   |

    Add the above info for Bowser. Don't forget to add his character_id.

71. Daisy is next. Find her id by viewing the character_id and name columns for only her row.
72. The info for Daisy looks like this:

|  birthday  | height | weight |
| :--------: | :----: | :----: |
| 1989-07-31 |  NULL  |  NULL  |

Add the above info for Daisy to more_info. Be sure to add her character_id as well. You can use NULL or simply not include the null columns when inserting.

73. Null values show up as blank. Yoshi is last. Find his id by viewing the character_id and name columns for only his row.

74. The info for Yoshi looks like this:

|  birthday  | height | weight |
| :--------: | :----: | :----: |
| 1990-04-13 |  162   |  59.1  |

Add the above info for Yoshi to more_info. Be sure to include his character_id.

75. There should be a lot of data in more_info now. Take a look at all the rows and columns in it.
76. It looks good. There is something you can do to help out though. What units do the height and weight columns use? It's centimeters and kilograms, but nobody will know. Rename the height column to height_in_cm.
77. Rename the weight column to weight_in_kg.
78. Next, you will make a sounds table that holds filenames of sounds the characters make. You created your other tables similar to this:

    `CREATE TABLE table_name();`

    Inside those parenthesis you can put columns for a table so you don't need to add them with a separate command, like this:

    `CREATE TABLE table_name(column_name DATATYPE CONSTRAINTS);`

    Create a new table named sounds. Give it a column named **sound_id** of type **SERIAL** and a constraint of **PRIMARY KEY**.

79. View the tables in mario_database to make sure it worked.
80. There's your sounds table. Add a column to it named **filename**. Make it a **VARCHAR** that has a max length of **40** and with constraints of **NOT NULL** and **UNIQUE**. You can put those constraints at the end of the query to add them all.
81. You want to use **character_id** as a **foreign key** again. This will be a "one-to-many" relationship because one character will have many sounds, but no sound will have more than one character. Here's the example again:

`ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE CONSTRAINT REFERENCES referenced_table_name(referenced_column_name);`

Add a column to sounds named **character_id**. Give it the properties **INT**, **NOT NULL**, and set it as a foreign key that references **character_id** from characters.

82. Take a look at the details of the sounds table to see all the columns.
83. Next, you will add some rows. But first, view all the data in characters so you can find the correct id's again. Order them by character_id like you did earlier.
84. The first file is named **its-a-me.wav**. Insert it into the **sounds** table with **Mario's** id as the **character_id**.
85. Add another row with a filename of **yippee.wav**. Use **Mario's** character_id again for the foreign key value.
86. Add another row to sounds for Luigi named ha-ha.wav. Use his character_id this time. Take a look at the data in characters to find his id if you need to.
87. Add another row with a filename of oh-yeah.wav. This one is for Luigi as well so use his character_id again.
88. Add two more rows for Peach sounds. The filenames are yay.wav and woo-hoo.wav. Don't forget her character_id. Try to do it with one command.
89. Add two more rows. The filenames are mm-hmm.wav and yahoo.wav. The first one is for Peach again, the second is for Mario, so use the correct foreign key values. Try to do it with one command
90. See the "one-to-many" relationship? Create another new table called actions. Give it a column named action_id that's a type of SERIAL, and make it the PRIMARY KEY. Try to create the table and add the column with one com.
91. Add a column named action to your new table. Give it a type of VARCHAR that is a max length of 20 and has UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints.
92. The actions table won't have any foreign keys. It's going to have a "many-to-many" relationship with the characters table. This is because many of the characters can perform many actions. You will see why you don't need a foreign key later. Insert a row into the actions table. Give it an action of run.
93. insert another action jump.
94. insert another action duck.
95. View all the data in actions to make sure there's no mistakes.
96. It looks good. **"Many-to-many"** relationships usually use a **junction** table to link two tables together, forming two **"one-to-many" relationships**. Your characters and actions table will be linked using a junction table. Create a new table called **character_actions**. It will describe what actions each character can perform.
97. Your junction table will use the primary keys from the **characters** and **actions** tables as foreign keys to create the relationship. Add a column named **character_id** to your junction table. Give it the type of **INT** and constraint of **NOT NULL**
98. The foreign keys you set before were added when you created the column. You can set an existing column as a foreign key like this:

`ALTER TABLE table_name ADD FOREIGN KEY(column_name) REFERENCES referenced_table(referenced_column);`

Set the **character_id** column you just added as a foreign key that references the character_id from the characters table.

99. Add another column to character_actions named action_id. Give it a type of INT and constraint of NOT NULL.
100. This will be a foreign key as well. Set the action_id column you just added as a foreign key that references the action_id column from the actions table.
101. Every table should have a primary key. Your previous tables had a single column as a primary key. This one will be different. You can create a **primary** key from two columns, known as a **composite primary key**. Here's an example:

`ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY(column1, column2);`

Use character_id and action_id to create a composite primary key for this table.

102. This table will have multiple rows with the same **character_id**, and multiple rows the same **action_id**. So neither of them are unique. But you will never have the same **character_id** and **action_id** in a single row. So the two columns together can be used to uniquely identify each row. View the details of the **character_actions** table to see your composite key.
103. Insert three rows into **character_actions** for all the actions **Yoshi** can perform. He can perform all of them in the actions table. View the data in the characters and actions table to find the correct id's for the information
104. view all the details of **character_actions** table
105. Add three more rows into character_actions for all of Daisy's actions. She can perform all of the actions, as well.
106. Bowser can perform all the actions. Add three rows to the table for him.
107. Next is Toad. Add three more rows for his actions.
108. You guessed it. Peach can perform all the actions as well, so add three more rows for her.
109. Add three more rows for Luigi's actions.
110. Last is Mario, add three rows for his actions.
111. That was a lot of work. View all the data in character_actions to see the rows you ended up with.
112. Well done. The database is complete for now. Take a look around to see what you ended up with. First, display all the tables you created
113. There's five tables there. Nice job. Next, take a look at all the data in the characters table.
114. Those are some lovely characters. View all the data in the more_info table.
115. You can see the **character_id** there so you just need to find the matching id in the **characters** table to find out who it's for. Or... You added that as a foreign key, that means you can get all the data from both tables with a JOIN command:

`SELECT columns FROM table_1 FULL JOIN table_2 ON table_1.primary_key_column = table_2.foreign_key_column;`

Enter a join command to see **all** the info from both tables. The two tables are **characters** and **more_info**. The columns are the **character_id** column from both tables since those are the linked keys.

116. Now you can see all the info from both tables. If you recall, that's a "one-to-one" relationship. So there's one row in each table that matches a row from the other. Use another JOIN command to view the characters and sounds tables together. They both use the character_id column for their keys as well.
     `mario_database=> SELECT * FROM characters FULL JOIN sounds ON characters.character_id = sounds.character_id;`

117. This shows the "one-to-many" relationship. You can see that some of the characters have more than one row because they have many sounds. How can you see all the info from the characters, actions, and character_actions tables? Here's an example that joins three tables:

```
SELECT columns FROM junction_table
FULL JOIN table_1 ON junction_table.foreign_key_column = table_1.primary_key_column
FULL JOIN table_2 ON junction_table.foreign_key_column = table_2.primary_key_column;
```

Congratulations on making it this far. This is the last step. View all the data from characters, actions, and character_actions by joining all three tables. When you see the data, be sure to check the "many-to_many" relationship. Many characters will have many actions.

118. mario_database=> SELECT \* FROM characters FULL JOIN actions ON characters.character_id = actions.action_id FULL JOIN character_actions ON charac
     ters.character_id = chracter_actions.characcter_i
